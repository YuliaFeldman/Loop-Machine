# Loop Machine
 Loop Machine web application
 
### Description:
 
This is a 9-Pads Loop Machine. It contains 9 pads (squares) with two states, on and off. State of a pad can be changed by  clicking on the pad. There are also two control buttons, play and stop, to control the loop. Each square represents a loop sample. When a pad is turned on, it starts playing its loop exactly on the same starting point of all other loops playing (all loops are synced). Lopps are repeated as long as the pad is on.
All loops are based on 120BPM.
